This program has a glitch when you first clone it. The combat system it pulls from is an older version
at first so you have to re-save the new version. Once you're in the main folder type 'vim src/combat.cpp'
and when you get to that folder type ':wq'. After that and you're back to the main folder complie with 'make' 
and to the play the game type './game'.

The game instructions are listed when you start the game but will
also be listed here. You preform the listed instructions by typing 
them into the terminal and pressing enter. Taking inputs upon key 
press was an explored option but it required incompatible libraries.

The are no known bugs besides the fact that there is no real sense of 
player orientation in the game. What's left and right will always be what's 
left and right. There could be spelling errors here and there but we got 
rid of most of them in testing. 

Controls:
